        "Welcome to lab 6 of EE 467! Today we are going to learn and try out **ensemble learning** algorithms, which make use of multiple learning algorithms to achieve better performance than any of them. We will apply four kinds of common ensembles to the Kaggle credit card fraud detection problem: **voting, bagging, boosting and stacking**. We will also try **random forest** learning, which is a special kind of bagging ensemble that consists of decision trees. Like the previous lab, all algorithms are evaluated by **accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score**.\n",

        "\n",
        "Boosting is an ensemble learning technique that aims to combine **a set of weak learners** (a classifier that is only **slightly better** than a random classifier) into a strong learner. It is able to reduce both the bias and variance of the original classification models. A boosting algorithm usually consists of **iteratively learning weak classifiers** with respect to a distribution and **adding them to a final strong classifier**. Weak classifiers are typically weighted in some way that is related to its performance. After a weak learner is added, sample weights are re-adjusted so that **misclassified samples are stressed** and correctly classified samples are paid less attention to. This causes future weak learners to focus more on samples that previous weak learners fail, thus making the ensemble more robusting against variations in sample features.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the following code cell, we will try two kinds of boosting ensembles: **[AdaBoost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AdaBoost) and [gradient boosting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_boosting)**. Both use one-level (as opposed to full, deep) decision trees as base weak classifiers. AdaBoost adjusts the weights of training samples and weak classifiers based on the accuracy, while gradient boosting adjusts the weights by differentiating through the target loss and computing the correponsing gradient for gradient descent."

        "The last ensemble learning scheme is **stacking**, which is also the most sophisticated one among the four we have introduced today. Like all previous types of ensemble, a stacking ensemble contains a number of classifiers, each possibly using a distinct machine learning algorithm. However, we would perform $K$-fold **cross validation** during training on each classifier, so each classifier actually has $K$ clones that are trained on different parts of the training samples. The cross validation also provides us with the **validation predictions for all samples**, gathered from the $K$ clones. After training all base classifiers, we collect and concatenate the validation predictions from clones of different classifiers as features, and then **train a meta-classifier** that predicts the sample label for the whole ensemble.\n",

For the $K$ clones of the same classifier, we **average their outputs** which are usually the probability distribution over all classes. Like the training data, we then **concatenate the averaged outputs** from different classifiers as features, and finally pass them to the meta-classifier to obtain predictions."
